Club Penguin Rewritten's old server emulator - used for production

All code is owned by Hagrid and was created for Club Penguin Rewritten (cprewritten.net), which is now discontinued.
I probably won't be creating tutorials on how to set this up or be updating the code, so feel free to modify it.

Please do not use this emulator for a CPR clone/rip-off.
